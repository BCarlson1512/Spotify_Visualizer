# Spotify_Visualizer
Picture this: Its 2014, and Trap Nation has dropped another absolute heater on their channel. You click to the video to listen to the absolute heat that was just dropped. The audio loads and with it, the epilepsy triggering visualizer plays.

The aim of this project is to recreate the epilepsy inducing visualizer from Trap Nation's glory days, but now allowing us to sync it to any spotify song, rather than having to wait for the newest trap nation heater...
